# odin-recipes
This is a simple web development project that displays three of my favorite cooking recipes.
It was a really fun project to do and a great refresher for the fundamental HTML concepts.
Most of what was demonstrated was the basic tags like paragraphs, headings, ordered/unordered lists, links and images.

Overall, I'm happy with how the project turned, some of the images of overly large for the pages but I'm assuming
things like that will be covered in future lessons. My main struggle with this project was trying to figure out
how often I should commit changes through git, and I ended up mostly just committing every time I added something
to the page.
